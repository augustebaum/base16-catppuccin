A series of base16-compatible schemes for the [`catppuccin` theme](catppuccin.com).

The port was made at the same time as a [similar project for the `wezterm`
terminal emulator](https://github.com/augustebaum/base16-wezterm),
thus I used [the pre-existing `wezterm` theme script](https://github.com/catppuccin/wezterm/blob/main/catppuccin.lua)
as a guide.

My hope is to eventually have this integrated and managed by the `catppuccin` team,
who are in a much better position to judge which colors should be where.

TODO:
- [X] Port `catppuccin-latte`.
- [X] Port `catppuccin-frappe`.
- [ ] Port `catppuccin-macchiato`.
- [ ] Port `catppuccin-mocha`.
